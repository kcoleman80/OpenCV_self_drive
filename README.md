# OpenCV_self_drive
Using OpenCV to do lane detection 
Building a software pipeline that can automatically detect lanes in a video stream from a front-facing camera mounted on a car.
Our goal is to create a program that can read photos and output an annotated video that shows the following:
1. The current lane
2. The radius of curvature of the lane
3. The position of the vehicle relative to the middle of the lane
